            how the box model and relative positioning can be used to achieve this. -->

        <!-- Each of these divs should take up 50% of the browser width and be centered
            in the browser window. Use relative positioning to achieve this. You should
            also set the background of the div to some color and round the corners
            a little bit (5 pixels) -->

        <!-- Each image should take up 50% of its containing div and be centered within
            the div. -->

        <!-- Once you have the layout working, you should give each
            image short but descriptive alternate text. This is useful for
            screen readers or when your images don't load -->
