        <!-- This div should be fixed to the top of the browser. When you
            scroll, it shouln't move The header div should always be on top of
            other content (look at z-index). Also give the div a grey background,
            a height of 75 pixels, and padding of 20 pixels -->

        <!-- The title header should be on the left side of the containing div.
            The course header should be on the right side (you should use display
            and float to achieve this). -->
        <!-- Both headers should have white text -->

        <!-- Intructions continued: -->

        <!-- None of these divs should overlap each other or the header div. Think about
            how the box model and relative positioning can be used to achieve this. -->

        <!-- Each of these divs should take up 50% of the browser width and be centered
            in the browser window. Use relative positioning to achieve this. You should
            also set the background of the div to some color and round the corners
            a little bit (5 pixels) -->

        <!-- Each image should take up 50% of its containing div and be centered within
            the div. Give them each a top and bottom margin of 20 pixels-->

        <!-- Once you have the layout working, you should give each
            image short but descriptive alternate text. This is useful for
            screen readers or when your images don't load -->
